BLE_Tests has 2 folders within it. These are BLE tests for the 2 (or more) beacons, and the one central hub. The beacons should have their colors changed in code, get flashed and spread around. The central device should be portable. Folders should be opened in VS Code (Particle workbench should be installed). 

CapSensorTest folder should also be opened in VS Code.
